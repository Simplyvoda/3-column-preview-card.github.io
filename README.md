## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://simplyvoda.github.io/3-column-preview-card.github.io/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

On this project i struggled with making the design reponive for screen sizes 768px-1440px . I will continue to work on responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Responsove media screen templates](https://gist.github.com/marcobarbosa/798569) - This helped me get the exact screen sizes for the media query. I really liked this pattern although i didnt use the code word for word, i will use it going forward.
